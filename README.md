# NumPy Introduction 
NumPy(Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for Python numerical computing. It provides efficient multi-dimensional array objects and various mathematical functions for handling large datasets making it a critical tool for professionals in fields that require heavy computation.

## Key Features of NumPy
NumPy has various features that make it popular over lists.

* N-Dimensional Arrays: NumPyâ€™s core feature is ndarray, a powerful N-dimensional array object that supports   homogeneous data types.
* Arrays with High Performance: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, enabling faster computations than Python lists.
* Broadcasting: This allows element-wise computations between arrays of different shapes. It simplifies operations on arrays of various shapes by automatically aligning their dimensions without creating new data.
* Vectorization: Eliminates the need for explicit Python loops by applying operations directly on entire arrays.
* Linear algebra: NumPy contains routines for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication,    decompositions, and determinants.

## Installing NumPy in Python
To begin using NumPy, you need to install it first. This can be done through pip command:

```bash
    pip install numpy
```

Once installed, import the library with the alias np

```bash
    import numpy as np
```


## Python Numpy
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
