# NumPy Introduction 
NumPy(Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for Python numerical computing. It provides efficient multi-dimensional array objects and various mathematical functions for handling large datasets making it a critical tool for professionals in fields that require heavy computation.

## Key Features of NumPy
NumPy has various features that make it popular over lists.

* N-Dimensional Arrays: NumPyâ€™s core feature is ndarray, a powerful N-dimensional array object that supports   homogeneous data types.
* Arrays with High Performance: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, enabling faster computations than Python lists.
* Broadcasting: This allows element-wise computations between arrays of different shapes. It simplifies operations on arrays of various shapes by automatically aligning their dimensions without creating new data.
* Vectorization: Eliminates the need for explicit Python loops by applying operations directly on entire arrays.
* Linear algebra: NumPy contains routines for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication,    decompositions, and determinants.

## Installing NumPy in Python
To begin using NumPy, you need to install it first. This can be done through pip command:

```bash
    pip install numpy
```

Once installed, import the library with the alias np

```bash
    import numpy as np
```
